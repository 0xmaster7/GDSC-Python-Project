# GDSC-Python-Project

These are the two projects that those who got selected into the Python subdomain had to do

The folder "CHIP-8Emulator" contains the C++ code for my attempt at CHIP-8 emulation. More details about how the code works and will be documented in the README file present in the folder.

The folder "PythonBot" contains the python code for my attempt at creating a discord bot that can interact with the Gemini API, create polls and remind the user after a given time duration. More details about how the code works and will be documented in the README file present in the folder.
